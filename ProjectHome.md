It's a bomberman-like game, not a bomberman clone, because we intend to implement some original ideas.

It's multiplayer oriented because we want to deliver a unique online gaming experience, with fully customized characters, interactive maps, among other.

It's bomberman because we love bomberman and we are developers, so we can make the best bomberman-like game.

We'll use C++11 (will depend upon GCC 4.7 or later) and Qt4.
